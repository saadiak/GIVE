## About
GIVE is a web app that connects non-profit organizations with individuals intending to make goods-based donations (bedding, clothing, food, etc).Consumer culture encourages everyone to overspend and overbuy. Often, people end up with more goods than they actually need. GIVE provides individuals with the opportunity to donate these extra materials as opposed to wasting or neglecting them.

## Technologies Used
Our Front End is comprised of HTML and CSS while our backend consists of Python Flask. In addition, we used MongoDB as a data base to store various information such as contact email, location, etc.
